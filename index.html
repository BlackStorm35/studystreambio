  Hi, this is an extended version of my bio, where I get to write whatever the hell I want so get ready to read a
  testament :v
</h1>

<p>
  I try not to be a dick so if you pin me I will pin you back, and add you to a list I have, if you pin me back again 3
  days in a row, <br />I will assume you want to be my accountability partner so I would add you as a favorite as
  hopefully see each other reach our goals.
</p>

<p>
  I am a tech and numbers freak, wherever I can apply them I do (this will make sense later on) I have realized that
  life is way easier when you drop expectations and ego :v
</p>
<p>
  This is not tinder, so I pin male and females, and I am looking for study buddies ;) <br />
  If you are a female, don’t worry by pinning me or sending me encouragements I wont think that you like me. I am too
  young, too selfish and I am not actively seeking for a girlfriend so if we text, I am not flirting with you, I am just
  being friendly.
</p>

  I am currently working on improving the amount of effective time I study. I have been struggling with studying as most
  of the material I now study is all in English (and as you can tell from my writing English is not my first language, I
  do have the TOEFL and have worked multiple jobs in English so speaking it is not hard, what is is hard is memorizing
  study material in English) I once saw a video titled How I effortlessly study 4 hours with no Break when I learned
  that interruptions can increase stress levels and decrease productivity, as it takes an average of 25 minutes to
  regain focus after an interruption (study made my Michigan State university and the by Mark, Gudith, and Klocke) So
  that kind of hit me, since then I time myself to do everything (I made my own custom stopwatch app that allows me to
  add detailed notes to my laps so I divide my spent time in either (productive (anything related to studies) or
  unproductive (anything that is not studies, so naps, lunch, breaks, interruptions etc.) This is how my times look
  like:

<img src="images/image2.png" style="width: 50%; height: auto" />

<p>
  For now I usually get around 6 hours of effective study time (time spent focusing for learning the material by heart
  not just learn and forget, I can get more study time but would not be learning things. (on my timer every time I get
  an interruption I subtract 5-10 min to the productive time, so yes this is already becoming toxic because I have
  implemented quite some drastic measures to force myself to stay productive. I started really slow and small, but it
  snowballed from there:<br />
  -Removed all distractions from my room, this includes:<br />
  -Do not disturb on laptop, iPad and smartphone (set up so only close family can reach me)<br />
  -Paying for a more advance parental control apps because the one from apple is too basic, password is set by 2 users
  (so I need both users to be present to access distracting sites during studying days)<br />
  -Social media is only available on my days off and even those days it is limited on the amount of time I can spend on
  each app.<br />
  -Using hardwire earplugs, and headsets on top (playing a combination of brown music and the same piano song in
  loop)(also got some noise cancelling headsets, they are ugly but are kind of special since <br />
  it is designed for people that are exposed to loud sounds so mowing Workshops Snow blowing)<br />
  -Logging most things I do during the day in a simple stopwatch website I build that allows me to not only log the laps
  but also add comments on each one of the lap (it is divided into 2 sections: <br />
  productive (anything related to certifications and study, and anything else is considered unproductive time (eat,
  breaks, naps, etc). <br />
  -Daily journaling at the end of the day so it helps me unload the most important things I did during the day (I use
  OneNote) and also set my to do things for the next day. So essentially thanks to this<br />
  and the logs I have I am able to tell what I was doing at any given day and hour from this year. I think people call
  this the second brain technique.<br />
  -Also have multiple social media profiles for example I have around 8 YouTube profiles, so each profile only suggests
  me videos related to the things I want to see at that time (like anything engineering <br />
  or how things work, politic and economics, money, gym, comedy, etc.).<br />
  -carefully considering what I eat so I never get full, so I don’t have mental fatigue. <br />
  -carefully considering when is the last meal usually 3.5 hours before bedtime so I reduce the number of times that I
  wake up to pee and also allow my body to actually rest and heal.<br />
  -I take a 40 min nap everyday around 4pm so I wake up mentally sharp.<br />
  -I go to the gym twice a week and do a 3.5-4 hours workouts where I burn around 1500-2000 cals per workout (it took me
  a long time to get to this level), I also do exercises that promote BDNF production <br />
  to stay "focused" but frankly speaking I have not seen the focus benefits)(also because in the last 1.5 years I lost
  40 pounds, yes I gained 40 pounds since covid because I was not moving my lazy ass. <br />
  -Filtering email so when I get a spam email, I don’t only unsubscribe, but my Gmail automatically removes them)<br /><br />

  I try to keep my private life private so venting all these details feels off and weird but if you read this far, and
  there is something you would like to suggest I do, I am all ears. <br />

  I have been doing all these for over a year but plan to keep doing it a lot more (even after getting a job as a <br />
  cloud engineer, as I strongly believe that you should never stop learning since that gives you a edge over others,<br />
  so that opens doors for many other things in life)(and that my Bugatti won’t buy itself) Also, I am doing these <br />
  because my focus is currently on a pretty bad condition, normal to most poeple but at least bad if I compare it with
  <br />
  my focus and memory when I was on high school (I was the nerd and athletic one)<br />

<h3>Current struggles:</h3>
<p>
  -Wake up time is fixed at 6:30 but bedtime is irregular so some days I get 7.5 and others 9 hours. But the actual time
  I sleep is less because it takes me a lot of time to sleep. There are times where I am already in bed and takes me
  around 1.5 hours to fall asleep (according to my tracker) I have tried magnesium glycinate, melatonin (2.5mg,5mg, 10mg
  of immediate release and also 10mg of timed released with no luck (if I take the immediate release one, I fall sleep
  quite quickly but then as soon as the effect is over I wake up around the 6th hour so I wake up tired and if I use the
  time released one I don’t wake up but I struggle to go to sleep. <br />
  -I tend to fall into the cycle of thinking that I must adjust my plans based on new data which is good, but I take it
  to the extreme when I spend a lot of time planning and little time actually performing. For example, every time a new
  version of ChatGPT is launched I have to read all the documentation, reviews and see how I can better implement it on
  my current use, so I maximize the responses I get and use it to improve my thinking skills instead of using it like a
  simple search tool. <br /><br />
  Even after implementing all the above, I still struggle to focus because when anything left to do is studying even
  watching an ant walking by becomes more interesting ;( <br /><br /><br />
  If you read this far you are crazy! Fortunately for you I like crazy. Like I say this is not tinder, so I pin male and
  females, and I am looking for study buddies. If you are a female, don’t worry by pinning me or sending me
  encouragements I won’t think that you like me. We would have to share a lot of things in common and I would need to
  feel comfortable around you to ever consider someone as a potential partner, I just like to get to know someone at a
  deeper level before stablishing a relationship, so this is why body is not a big deal for me. So if I like you, I have
  the balls to tell you, but that does not mean I plan or want to do something about it.
  <br />
  So, you are safe to approach, now you know why I won’t try anything weird. If you want to become my study buddy, I
  believe I gave enough information so you can see if this friendship could work.

<h3>Things that I like:</h3>
-Money <br />
-Mentally stimulating problems especially related to money and tech <br />
-I like the process of research in general (so the process from going from zero to hero) <br />

<br />
-To question everything.<br />
-Monk mode <br />
-Calisthenics <br />

-David Goggins (like Andrew Tate but related to the body) <br />
-Luke Belmar (he is a more balanced version of Tate and Goggins) <br />
