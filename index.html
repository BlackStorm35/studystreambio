Hello, this is an extender version of my bio, where I get to write whatever the hell I want so get ready to read a testament :v

I try not to be a dick so if you pin me I will pin you back, and add you to a list I have, if you pin me back again 3 days in a row I will assume you want 
to be my accountability partner so I would add you as a favorite as hopefully see each other reach our goals.

I am a tech and numbers freak, wherever I can apply them I do (this will make sense later on)
I have realized that life is way easier when you drop expectations and ego :v

This is not tinder so I pin male and females, and I am looking for study buddies ;) 

If you are a female, dont worry by pinning me or sending me encouragements I wont think that you like me. 
I am too young, too selfish and I am not actively seeking for a girlfriend so if we text I am not flirting with you, I am just being friendly.


Things that I like: 
-Money 
-Mentally stimulating problems especially related to money and tech
-I like the process of research in general (so the process from going from zero to hero)
-I like politics, economics and engineering.
-I like to understand why people think what they think or do what they do, this is why I like to make many questions.
-Monk mode
-Calistenics
-Andrew Tate (He’s not a misogynist; he’s a misanthrope)(he also makes a lot of mistakes but I like that he makes you feel that you are not doing enough, 
which angers me and then motivates me ;v)
-David goggins (like andrew tate but related to the body)
-Luke belmar (he is a more balanced version of Tate and Goggins)
-I also like piano (not instrumental, just piano) Like (Idea 12 and idea 15 by Gibran Alcocer, Luminary from joel Sunny, Nuvole bianche by Ludovico Einaudi)

Things that I try to run away from:
-People (nah just kidding)
-People with low self steem
-People with limiting believes
-People with no goals (IDK if your goal is to become a cashier or a CEO, as long as you have a goal I would respect it)
